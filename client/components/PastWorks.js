            <h3>Wage</h3>
            <p>Danced by Dare Ayorinde, Miriam Gabriel, Nick Sciscione, and Myssi Robinson, Wage exposed white supremacy and capitalism wound within our American bodies. This country was discovered by venture capitalists and radical religious thinkers. Our economic strength is powered by a battery of 250 years of slave labor. Our American bodies are both victims and perpetrators of this weighted cycle. WAGE moves us through these patterns of our dark history to unveil American truth. The dance has original music by Jon Johnson and a lobby installation by visual artist and dancer, Myssi Robinson.</p>

            <h3>Roam</h3>
            <p>Writer and New York City activist Jane Jacobs wrote that old cities are, "all composed of movement and change, and although it is life, not art, we may fancifully call it the art form of the city and liken it to the dance." Roam is a work for five dancers inspired by urban planning that highlights the ways people are physically organized, emotionally affected, and socially structured by the city environments we build. New York based composer Tristan Perich’s architecturally dense music incorporates piano and electronic sounds, evoking images of smooth glass, tall structures, hard pavement and waves of people etching their ways through the space.</p>
