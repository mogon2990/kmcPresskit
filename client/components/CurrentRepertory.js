            <h3>Colored</h3>
            <p>Colored navigates the beautifully twisted spectrum of blackness that dancers Dare Ayorinde, Kyle Marshall and Myssi Robinson regularly embody. As three black dancers from varied backgrounds who work primarily with white artists, their work together in the studio leads to conversations on tokenism, appropriation, stereotype and representation. Colored is a filter for these thoughts and a celebration of cultural variation. This work features original music by Matt Clegg and was commissioned in-part by "Dance on the Lawn" Montclair Dance Festival, EMoves: Harlem Stage, and Jersey (New) Moves at NJPAC.</p>

            <h3>King</h3>
            <p>King uses Martin Luther King Jr.’s final speech, I’ve Been to the Mountaintop as a soundscore. The speech encompassed the Memphis Sanitation Strike, economic inequality, black power and prophesied his death the following day. This solo admires how ideas, words, and actions can instigate revolution. It considers the effort and willing struggle of one body in order to create better future.</p>
            <p>Choreography and Performer: Kyle Marshall</p>
            <p>Text: “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop” April 3rd, 1968 by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
